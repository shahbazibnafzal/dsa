# Patterns

Patterns are the best way to master loops. Usually patterns need nested loops and there are some key points to solve them.

Patterns have rows and columns.

- Outer loop should be used for rows
- Inner loop is for columns and connect them somehow to the rows
- Print the character inside the inner loop
- Observe symmetry (Optional)
